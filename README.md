## Hacktopia2025

# intro
Project we made for the AE Hackathon

It is a website that can look up locations and based on that gives you recipes to grow your own ingredients.

The theme was "Build your own planet" so we made it a little alien themed and as subtheme we chose "Food"

# practival

the backend is python. 

For the hackathon we hosted everything on aws
